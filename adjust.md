Here are the key differences between your original code and the modified version I provided:

### 1. **`group` class on `NavigationMenuItem`:**

   **Original Code:**
   ```jsx
   <NavigationMenuItem key={item.name}>
   ```

   **Modified Code:**
   ```jsx
   <NavigationMenuItem key={item.name} className="group">
   ```

   - I added the `group` class to the `NavigationMenuItem`. This is necessary for grouping and applying hover styles to child elements when the `NavigationMenuItem` is hovered over. The `group` class allows child elements (like the underline) to react to the parent hover state.

### 2. **Added a `span` for the hover underline effect:**

   **Original Code:**
   ```jsx
   <span class="absolute bottom-0 left-1/2 w-0 h-1 bg-blue-500 group-hover:animate-underline-grow transform -translate-x-1/2"></span>
   ```

   **Modified Code:**
   ```jsx
   <span className="absolute bottom-0 left-1/2 w-0 h-1 bg-blue-500 group-hover:w-full transition-all duration-300 transform -translate-x-1/2" />
   ```

   - I replaced the existing `span` with a more refined hover effect. The original code used `group-hover:animate-underline-grow` (which is not defined and would not work without custom animations). I updated this to `group-hover:w-full` to smoothly transition the width from `0` to `100%` when the item is hovered.
   - I added `transition-all duration-300` to make the change in width animate smoothly over 300ms.

### 3. **Tailwind class for smooth transition:**

   **Original Code:**
   ```jsx
   group-hover:animate-underline-grow
   ```

   **Modified Code:**
   ```jsx
   transition-all duration-300
   ```

   - I replaced the non-existent `group-hover:animate-underline-grow` with `transition-all duration-300`. This ensures that the underline smoothly expands when the link is hovered.

### Summary of Changes:
- **`group` class** added to `NavigationMenuItem` to enable hover effects on child elements.
- **Underline element (`span`) added** for the hover effect with `group-hover:w-full` to control the underline's width on hover.
- **Smooth transition (`transition-all duration-300`)** for a better hover effect when expanding the underline.

These adjustments provide the underline hover effect you were looking for with smooth transitions.
